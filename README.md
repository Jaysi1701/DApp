# Dapp for Land Registry System using Blockchain

## Overview
The Land Registry System is a decentralized application (DApp) built using Blockchain technology to securely and transparently maintain the ownership and transfer of land records. This system utilizes blockchain's immutability to eliminate intermediaries and reduce fraud in land transactions.

## Features
- **Secure Ownership Tracking**: Land ownership records are stored on the blockchain, ensuring they cannot be altered or tampered with.
- **Immutable Records**: Once a record is added to the blockchain, it is permanent, offering a verifiable history of land ownership.
- **Efficient Transactions**: Buyers and sellers can conduct land transactions securely without relying on centralized authorities.
- **Smart Contracts**: Smart contracts automatically enforce the terms of land transactions, ensuring both parties meet their obligations.
- **Decentralized and Transparent**: All transactions are transparent and visible to all network participants, promoting trust and fairness.

## Usage
- **Land Registration**: Users can register land properties by submitting details such as location, area, and ownership.
- **Ownership Transfer**: Buyers and sellers can transfer ownership of land by making transactions that are confirmed by smart contracts.
- **Search Land Records**: Users can search land records by a unique identifier such as land ID.


## Tech Stack
- **Blockchain**: Ethereum (using Solidity for smart contract development)
- **Smart Contracts**: Written in Solidity
- **Backend**: Truffle framework (for smart contract management)
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (interacting with the blockchain via Web3.js)

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Install **Node.js**, which is required to manage the project's dependencies.
- Install **Truffle**, a framework for smart contract development:
  ```bash
  npm install -g truffle
- Install Ganache, a personal blockchain for Ethereum development.
- MetaMask Browser Extension

  ### Steps to Run the Project

1. **Clone the repository** to your local machine:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Jaysi1701/DApp.git
    ```
2. **Navigate into the project folder**:
    ```bash
    cd DApp
    ```
3. **Install all necessary dependencies** using Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager):
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
4. **Start Ganache** to run a local Ethereum blockchain for testing.
5. **Compile the smart contracts** to prepare them for deployment:
    ```bash
    truffle compile
    ```
6. **Migrate the smart contracts** to the local Ethereum blockchain using Truffle:
    ```bash
    truffle migrate
    ```
7. **Launch the frontend** by opening the project in any HTTP server (like the Live Server extension in Visual Studio Code or another local server).
